# Global COVID-19 Trends and New Case Prediction for the USA üöÄ

## Project Overview
This project analyzes, forecasts, and evaluates the spread of COVID-19 using both statistical and machine learning models. By leveraging the WHO COVID-19 dataset, we explore global trends, perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement various forecasting models‚Äîincluding ARIMA, SARIMA, Exog SARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM‚Äîto predict future case counts.

- **Country-specific Trends:** 
  - The USA experienced the highest case count in early 2022.
  - China saw a significant peak in late 2022.

### 3. Model Selection ü§ñ
We implemented time series forecasting models to predict future COVID-19 cases:
- **ARIMA Model**
- **SARIMA Model**
- **Exog SARIMA Model**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **LSTM**

### 4. Model Evaluation üìà
Models were evaluated using performance metrics such as MAE and RMSE.
The comparative chart below summarizes the evaluation:

| Model           | MAE        | RMSE       | 
|-----------------|------------|------------|
| ARIMA           | 134,360.86 | 157,527.53 | 
| SARIMA          | 97,100.10  | 128,000.76 | 
| EXOG SARIMA     | 79,852.14  | 93,150.65  | 
| Random Forest   | 68,322.60  | 81,348.77  | 
| XGBoost         | 122,012.04 | 181,259.30 |
| LSTM            | 411905.47  | 93155.53 |   

## Key Findings üìå
### EDA Insights
- **Regional Analysis:** EMRO and EURO regions show higher frequencies of case counts.
- **Multiple Waves:** Evidence of multiple COVID-19 waves (Delta and Omicron variants).
- **Country Trends:** 
  - The USA recorded the highest number of new cases in early 2022.
  - China saw the highest case count towards the end of 2022.
- **Mortality:** The USA observed the highest death toll, particularly in early 2021 and early 2022; India experienced a surge in mid-2021 due to the Delta variant.

### Modeling Insights
- **SARIMA and EXOG SARIMA:** Provide strong baseline forecasts.
- **Random Forest:** Minimizes MAE more effectively than ARIMA/SARIMA/exog SARIMA.
- **XGBoost:** Underperforms relative to Random Forest; may need additional tuning.
- **LSTM:** Performs poorly, making it worst approach for predicting new COVID-19 cases in the USA.
