# Global COVID-19 Trends and New Case Prediction for the USA üöÄ

## Project Overview
This project analyzes, forecasts, and evaluates the spread of COVID-19 using both statistical and machine learning models. By leveraging the WHO COVID-19 dataset, we explore global trends, perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement various forecasting models‚Äîincluding ARIMA, SARIMA, Exog SARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM‚Äîto predict future case counts.

### 3. Model Selection ü§ñ
We implemented time series forecasting models to predict future COVID-19 cases:
- **ARIMA Model**
- **SARIMA Model**
- **Exog SARIMA Model**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **LSTM**

### 4. Model Evaluation üìà
Models were evaluated using performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, AIC, and BIC. 
The comparative chart below summarizes the evaluation:

| Model           | MAE        | MSE         | RMSE       | AIC      | BIC      |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| ARIMA           | 134,360.86 | 2.48e+10    | 157,527.53 | 3380.63  | 3397.55  |
| SARIMA          | 97,100.10  | 1.64e+10    | 128,000.76 | 3462.81  | 3474.15  |
| EXOG SARIMA     | 79,852.14  | 8.67e+9     | 93,150.65  | 3669.55  | 3689.84  |
| Random Forest   | 68,322.60  | 6.6e+9      | 81,348.77  | N/A      | N/A      |
| XGBoost         | 122,012.04 | 3.28e+10    | 181,259.30 | N/A      | N/A      |
| LSTM (Training) | 81,126.04  | 3.43e+10    | 185,258.85 | N/A      | N/A      |
| LSTM (Test)     | **38,242.36**  | **5.6e+7**     | **56,711.65**  | N/A      | N/A      |

## Key Findings üìå
### EDA Insights
- **Regional Analysis:** EMRO and EURO regions show higher frequencies of case counts.
- **Multiple Waves:** Evidence of multiple COVID-19 waves (Delta and Omicron variants).
- **Country Trends:** 
  - The USA recorded the highest number of new cases in early 2022.
  - China saw the highest case count towards the end of 2022.
- **Mortality:** The USA observed the highest death toll, particularly in early 2021 and early 2022; India experienced a surge in mid-2021 due to the Delta variant.

### Modeling Insights
- **SARIMA and EXOG SARIMA:** Provide strong baseline forecasts.
- **Random Forest:** Minimizes MAE more effectively than ARIMA/SARIMA but shows higher RMSE.
- **XGBoost:** Underperforms relative to Random Forest; may need additional tuning.
- **LSTM (Test):** Outperforms all other models, making it the most effective approach for predicting new COVID-19 cases in the USA.
